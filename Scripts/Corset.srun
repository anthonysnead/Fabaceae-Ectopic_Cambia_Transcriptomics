# Here is an example run of corset. 
# -g indicates the treatment group for every file
# -n indicates the name of the sample
# You should first navigate to the directory with your sorted bam files (Bam_Path)
#!/bin/bash

#SBATCH --job-name=Corset
#SBATCH --cpus-per-task=1
#SBATCH --mem=100GB
#SBATCH --time=24:00:00

# Bam_Path is a place holder for your path
cd *Bam_Path*

# *Path* represents the path where you have placed the sif file

# This run is an example for our Phaseolus clustering where the samples were all from the same group.
